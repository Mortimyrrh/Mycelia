# ![Mycelia Logo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mortimyrrh/Mycelia-Forge/main/icons/mushroomx4.png) 1.16.4

## Info
Mycelia 1.16.x is curently under alpha development, please check back soon.  
  
## Main Goal
- To add a lightweight, super flat dimension for travelling long distances.  
   
To achieve this, there will be various ways of teleporting in and out of the dimension using items, portals and Endermen.
In the same way, every one block travelled in the nether is 8 blocks in the Overworld.
Every one block traveld in the Mycelial Network Dimension will result in 64 blocks travel in the overworld.
This allows players to travel greater distances in less time (and makes nether exsploration a breeze).
 
![1 Block in the Mycelial Network is equal to, 8 Blocks in the Nether is equal to, 64 Blocks in the Overworld](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Mortimyrrh/Mycelia-Forge/main/icons/1-8-64%20x2.png)  

1 Block in the Mycelial Network is equal to    
8 Blocks in the Nether equal to  
64 Blocks in the Overworld.
